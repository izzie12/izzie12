## 👋 Hi, I'm Isaac

I'm a **First-Class Computer Science graduate** from the University of East London with a deep passion for building technology that solves real-world problems.

### 🚀 Entrepreneur | Developer | Community Builder

As the **founder of [Chunguza Travel](https://chunguzatravel.com)**, I’m building a modern travel platform that connects East Africans to curated international holiday packages. It’s where my love for tech, product design, and African innovation all come together.

Beyond that, I’ve spent the last **5+ years freelancing**, building web and mobile apps for startups, NGOs, and small businesses around the world. My work blends strong business thinking with clean, scalable code.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, Expo, Tailwind CSS, HTML5, CSS3  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Supabase, MongoDB, Firebase  
- **Other Tools:** Git, Docker, Stripe, Odoo, Jest, Postman  
- **Platforms:** Vercel, Netlify, DigitalOcean, Railway

### 👥 Community Involvement

I lead a **developer meetup group** in London focused on mentorship, portfolio building, and career transitions into tech. We run hands-on workshops, mock interviews, and code reviews — all with the aim of helping junior devs grow with confidence.

I’m also passionate about **volunteering**. I’ve contributed my time and tech skills to community organizations in the UK and Uganda — building websites, creating training materials, and mentoring youth in digital literacy and entrepreneurship.

### 💡 Core Values

- Code that serves people, not just systems  
- Mentorship over competition  
- Solving local problems with global tools
